<h1>What Is Germination?</h1>
<p>Germination is a process in which a plant grows out from a seed by obtaining all the suitable and required conditions.</p>
<h1>The Flow Of Germination</h1>
<p>Every Plant starts out as a seed, This seed will only germinate when it will get the suitable conditions for it to live in, Such as : suitable temperature, suitable pH of soil , Mineral salts and many other things. After germination, the plant will grow into a seedling, and then a flowering plant allowing the plant to be able to reproduce and then a fully grown tree(not all plants become trees)</p>

<h1>The Process Of Photosynthesis</h1>
<p>Photosynthesis is a process in which plants synthesize food using (photons) light hence the name "PHOTO-SYNTHESIS" The word equation for photosynthesis is Water + Carbon Dioxide = Food(Glucose/Starch)+Oxygen. The chemical equation for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H20 âž± C6 H12 06 + 6O2</p>

<p>A lifecycle is a way in which an organism changes throughout its lifetime, reproduction is a vital part of the lifecycle as it does not let the particular species go extinct.</p>

<h1>Lifecycle Of Plants</h1>
<p>Plants start out as a seed, this seed germinates and then becomes a seedling, In order for this seedling to reproduce, The seedling needs flowers, so the next stage would be that of a flowering plant/Mature Plant. </p>
